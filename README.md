# About the game

I build this game based on a Warcraft 3 mod I use to play on a cybercafe, named [Line Tower Wars](https://www.epicwar.com/maps/159757/).

I have no previous experience on building Games but I wanted to try to build this one as I was not able to find any new version of it
that did not require you to have Warcraft installed.

The game is **UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT** which means that bugs will happen and changes/improvement will be constant, as much as I can on my free time.
At the end this is, for now, a really fun side project that I enjoy working on.

I'm totally open to any type of suggestions about the game.
