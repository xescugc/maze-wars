## Map

A tail == 16px

The maps are in an offset of 43 tails

Each line 18t wide, 16t of those are usable and the other 2t are the left and right corners

The spawn area is 7tx16t and the end area is 3tx16t the building area is 74tx16t

The separation between maps (if they are side by side) is of 10t and the vertical separation is also of 10t
